# BE-Enemies

## What is this?
This repository is where I'll be uploading various enemy prefabs for use
in the Bumper Engine, a Unity framework for creating fan-made Sonic games.

The purpose of this project is to give creators more options in creating and
designing their levels in the Bumper Engine, as, at the time of this writing, 
the base Bumper Engine package only comes with two usable enemy prefabs: a
Motobug and a GUN Beetle.

Current enemy prefabs include:
 * Generic Egg Pawn (Generations, WIP)
